MISSING TEXTURES

If the textures are missing in Blender, please reference the location of the Texture Map on your computer. In Blender go to:

Go to Material Properties tab - if you don't have a material, create one
Surface > Base Colour - Click the dot next to it and choose Image Texture
Navigate to where you have saved this asset and find the TextureMap folder, open it and select MasterMaterial1px PNG.
This should fix it!


BLURRY TEXTURES IN GAME ENGINES

The texture map in this asset is very small so double check things like mipmaps / filter mode that your material is using.
